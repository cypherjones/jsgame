# Classic Frogger Game
This is a spin on the classic Frogger game written in Javascript using prototypes. I'm actually old enough to have owned the orginal game back in the day.

To play the game you'll want to clone this repo to your own machine.

## How to play

The rules are pretty basic. You'll need to get your character from the starting point to the top of the game board without running into any enemies (bugs). Yep. That's it. 

## Technical

1. Download the repo
2. Find the folder where you cloned the repo
3. Open the html file in the browser of your choosing
4. Enjoy the pure simplicity
